To start off, here's little about myself-

I'm Udith Ishara Madusanka, a self-taught developer from Sri Lanka. I love building, experimenting, breaking things, and working with different tools and such, that's my favorite way to learn, if you want to know more about me, you can visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/udithishara)

Since I stopped blogging in 2012, I've been meaning to get back to it, but something else would always come up and the idea would get pushed into the background.Blogging has changed a lot since 2012. Back then [Blogger](https://blogger.com) was all the rage, nowadays there are many more options.

M main reasons for starting to blog once again after all this time are to share some of the things I've learnt over the years, document things so I dont forget them when I dont use them everyday and because I made it a personal goal to start blogging in 2021.

Over the past 2-3 years I've tried to build this site with
 - ReactJS using Google Spreadsheet as the data source ([Archived branch](https://github.com/udithishara/udith.is/tree/reactjs-archived))
 - From scratch with vanilla Javascript ([Archived branch](https://github.com/udithishara/udith.is/tree/Custom-SSG-from-scratch))

The React version was pretty good, but it was never intended to be production ready as I was directly quering Google Spreadsheets to get data. It was more of an experiment. The "from scratch" version was mostly to learn how to create a Static Site Generator from scratch, it was a good learning experience

But I was never completely satisfied with either of them to be the final version.  
Thanks to NuxtJS and with their content module, I'm hoping that I can truly focus on my goal and keep on posting.
